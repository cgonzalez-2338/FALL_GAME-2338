### Rating

★★★★☆
4 out of 5 stars.

## Summary

Splatoon is a Nintendo game, based on a post apocalypse world, where Inklings do their own thing and run the world in a modern "hip" way. In the game there are three modes: Story, Turf, and Ranked. In short Story Mode is where you play as agent 4 and go against octolings in a set of levels. In Turf Mode you play in opposing teams of four and cover the stage with your team's color ink. Whom ever has covered the stage most with their color wins. Lastly in Ranked mode, there are 4 different game modes; Tower Control, SplatZones, RainMaker, and Clam Blitz. All games pretty much play with a "capture the flag" like goal in mind. The key to winning is teamwork, while splatoon doesn't have voice chat (aside from the nintendo app) if you find yourself a group of 4 of your friends you might stand a chance, using effective teamwork to raise your rank.

## Final Thoughts

Splatoon Ranked Mode is both fun and frustrating, from the people who are afk to connection errors. Yet there is still this overwhelming joy from every win you recieve and see your rank getting higher and higher. Something I also like that nintendo paid attention to was a problem in splatoon 1, when a connection error happened the system took that as a lose, and lowered your rank even though you didn't even play. Now in spaltoon 2 ranked mode, they don't punish you for connection errors.
