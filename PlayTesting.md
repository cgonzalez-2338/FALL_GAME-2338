> _Answer:_ Of course, I love games that are around H.P Lovecraft's works. When the game was first announced I was super excited to play. During my playthough I was entertained and on the edge of my seat the whole way through. I can even come back and start a new game and still be entertained.

**Question:** During gameplay what problems or issues seemed to happen and how did you get them to reoccur?
> _Answer:_ I couldn't find any issues in the main game, there were a couple loading errors, and seeing thing be lowpoly and load into regular poly, but it didn't effect any gameplay whatsoever and mainly fixed itself. I had no issues.
