## Summary

The Witcher 3 is a single player, fantasy action RPG. You play as the Witcher Geralt of Rivia. The story is mainly about Geralt in search of his adoptive daughter Ciri, whom is also being hunted down by a terrifying group called "The Wild Hunt" who plan on using her abilities for their own benefits. There's also a war going on, I didn't really pay attention to that part, however it does come up depending on the areas Geralt is in. Sometimes it's brought up to how Geralt is treated by people because he's considered a "mutant" along with witches, and other non-human beings being treated as lower class...or just straight up killed. Geralt doesn't get killed because he's the main character. The game also has multiple endings, one of which I'm told that Geralt dies in, but I don't know the choices you have to make to get that ending.

For gameplay, there's a lot of side quests for you to level up with. Sometimes you'll need to grind a little, but the leveling up system seems pretty balanced in my opinion. Sometimes you don't even need to grind because of the power-ups and boosts you can apply to your swords with certain oils and potions you can drink. There's also a card game you can play called "Gwent" from what I've read and seen most players don't understand the rules of Gwent on the first playthrough but it’s not too hard to get, it just takes practice, it's a good way to get some money if you're low on your coin. 
The combat mechanic is okay, sometimes you can't do certain moves or use elemental signs for some reason. I'm not sure if it's a glitch or just the game taking time to load actions, but it can impact the combat and you end up getting hit a lot. Other times it's just a part of the story, like not using your fire burst because you're inside a house, or you don't want to attract attention to yourself, so you're only allowed to use your swords or fists.

Aside from gameplay the graphics and visuals are beautiful, everything looks nice, the world you're in is just beautiful to look at (and not pay attention that a war is going on). Certain details just make the world seem real, for example when it's raining, or going to rain you can see the dark clouds in the distance coming, and I personally think it’s just a nice touch to the world.

## Final Thoughts

All together I found this game very enjoyable. I was able to stay interested in the story, and characters. I loved the scenery and world you're put into along with the very good aspects of attention to details. I enjoyed the individual personalities that came with all the characters. The gameplay is fine, no real complaints aside from the occasional bugs during combat but it's not enough to ruin my whole gameplay experience. Some glitches and bugs even turn out to be entertaining at times. My final thoughts are, The Witcher 3 is a good, enjoyable game.
