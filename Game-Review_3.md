## Summary

This is another tale from the legend of Zelda series. You play as Link, a hylian boy that turns out to be the hero. The king chooses link to help against the villain Vaati. Whom used to be apart of the "Minish" people. (basically, just tiny fairy-like people) Until he was corrupted by the power of a Wizard's hat that was created by his master, originally a gift for the king. Vaati crashes the beginning festival and destroys the legendary sword, as well as turning Princess Zelda into stone and plans on using her essence to make himself more powerful. Link must travel through dungeons and obtain items that will help him save Zelda and defeat Vaati.

## Final Thoughts
I've always had a special place in my heart for almost all Zelda games. Even though this one isn't as popular as the main ones (OoT, MM, BoTW, SS) its still a nice and fun game to play. Its not a hard game, you may get stuck somewhere but the solution presents itself pretty quickly. There are fun sidequests that have you develop connections with the characters you meet along the way and the whole game including the story is just a fun time.
